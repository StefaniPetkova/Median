# Median
The logic of the implementation of the task is connected with creating 
different methods to solve the assignment step by step.
We create method(addIn) for storing previously rounded scores in an ArrayList.
The other method(findAndAddMedian) finds the median by sorting first the given scores ArrayList
and after calculating the median adds it to the new ArrayList that collects them.
